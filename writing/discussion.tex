\section{What We Learned}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Interesting discoveries...?

  \item Comparison of existing GT systems represented in our study.  
    Natural is here, transient is here, erasure is here, and they
        compare as...

      \item Threats to validity:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Racket stack traces
          \item Mutant sampling
          \item Blame trails do not necessarily capture all aspects of error reporting
          \item Transient blame adaptations
          \item More?
        \end{itemize}
