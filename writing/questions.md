## QUESTIONS

- can a mutator accidentally create a correct program or a program that does not signal an impedance mismatch (and produces some result)? Did this happen?

- should the `theats` section discuss the problem that the fully typed program does not exist when the actual programmer starts debugging and the programmer may choose to assign different types than the natural ones to these components?

- "\footnote{We use trail and rational programmer interchangeably from now on.}" ~~ are they truly isomporphic? I don't see how this works for "random trails." Or do you mean for just the natural trails?
