Putting the rational programmer to work means generating many mutants and turning
those into debugging scenarios. The process must start with a suitable
collection of representative programs (see sec.~\ref{sub:mutate-benchmarks}).
Since existing mutators do not generate useful mutants, the first step is to
develop new mutators (see sec.~\ref{sub:mutate-mutators}) and to validate their
suitability for this application (see sec.~\ref{sub:mutate-interesting}).

% As section~\ref{sec:challenges} explains, the first challenge is to
% generate a representative mistakes in representative software. This
% section explains the specific choices made for the first application
% of the method: the source and nature of the chosen benchmarks
% (sec.~\ref{sub:mutate-benchmarks}), the newly developed mutators
% (sec.~\ref{sub:mutate-mutators}), and why they are suitable for this
% experiment (sec.~\ref{sub:mutate-interesting}).
