\section{How to Make Benchmarks} \label{sec:mutate}

Given the comparable implementations of the three gradual typing systems,
the next step for applying our method is to obtain a set of fully
typed benchmarks that each comes with a single impedance mismatch between
its type specifications and its code. As we briefly discuss in
section~\ref{sec:challenges}, we derive such ill-typed benchmarks with
mutation analysis from well-typed programs.
