Over the past decade, \citet{gtnffvf-jfp-2019} have curated a collection of
Typed Racket programs for systematically measuring the implementation's
performance. The benchmark suite consists of fully typed, correct programs,
written by a number of different authors, who have maintained and evolved these
programs over several years. The programs range widely in size, complexity,
purpose, and in programming style. The latter is mostly a reference to their
reliance on many Typed Racket features: occurrence typing~\cite{tf-icfp-2010},
types for mutable and immutable data structures~\cite{hpst-sfp-2010}, types for
first-class classes and objects~\cite{tsdtf-oopsla-2012}, and types for Racket's
numeric tower~\cite{stathff-padl-12}.

Since mixing of typed and untyped code in Typed Racket takes place at the module
level, the experiment calls for benchmarks with a decent number of modules and a
variety of module dependency graphs. Filtering the benchmark suite using these
criteria yields ten suitable programs. Figure~\ref{table:benchmark-descriptions}
displays the selected benchmark programs and describes their basic
characteristic.
