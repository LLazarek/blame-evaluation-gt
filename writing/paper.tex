\begin{abstract}
Programming language theoreticians develop blame assignment systems
and prove blame theorems for gradually typed programming languages.
Practical implementations of gradual typing almost completely ignore
the idea of blame assignment.  This contrast raises the question
whether blame assignment provides any value to the working programmer
and poses the challenge of how to evaluate the effectiveness of blame
assignment strategies. This paper contributes (1) the first evaluation
method for blame assignment strategies and (2) the results from applying
it to three different gradual type systems. These results confirm that blame assignment
is helpful to a rationally acting programmer.
