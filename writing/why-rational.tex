The general challenge of evaluating blame is a methodological one. Unlike most
current research on programming languages, the question seems to call for
empirical research similar to that of human-computer interaction. At the same
time, a significant evaluation result demands a large amount of
data. As~\citet{lksfd-popl-2020} recently demonstrated, the way around this
dilemma is to postulate the {\em rational programmer\/}---the equivalent of a
{\it homo economicus\/} for programming languages---and to implement it as an algorithm.

In the context of gradual typing, the rational programmer translates the
Wadler-Findler slogan into a debugging method, searching for the source of the
impedance mismatch in an incremental fashion. Measuring this simulated
programmer's behavior on a large number of debugging scenarios yields data that
is similar to data collected in an empirical, human-facing manner.
