Section~\ref{sec:why-rational} explains, and illustrates with an example,
how a migratory type setting helps with finding the source of an impedance
mismatch. Roughly speaking, it encourages the rational programmer to
equip a module with types if it is blamed in an error message. A sequence
of such steps make up a portion of the migratory path in the lattice of
type migration~\cite{tfgnvf-popl-2016}. The lattice, described in Section
~\ref{sub:stuff},  serves as the common substrate for the definition modes
of the rational programmer mentioned in section~\ref{sec:challenges}. 

Each mode receives different kinds of information and thus may construct
different paths in the lattice. As discussed in~\ref{sec:challenges},
evaluating blame relies on comparing modes of the rational programmer
within the same semantics and across different semantics.  

Hence the research problem is how to make the actions of a rational programmer
comparable across all semantics. Sections~\ref{sub:natural}
through~\ref{sub:erasure} describe the various mode of the rational programmer and explain
to what extent they are comparable. Section\ref{sub:experiment}
enhances comparability with the programmer-effort dimension. Finally, the last
subsection states the experimental questions and gives an overview of the
experimental process.
