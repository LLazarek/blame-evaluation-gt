Instructions for setup

* Installation

** on Linux
Clone this repo.
/Suggestion/: create a new directory and clone it in there.

After cloning, run
: blame-evaluation-gt/bex/setup/install-racket-and-setup.sh
with two arguments:
1. The "project root".
   Typically, this should be the parent directory into which you cloned this repo.
2. A setup config, typically one of =blame-evaluation-gt/bex/setup/*-setup-config.rkt=.

This setup script will
1. Download and set up a fresh copy of racket dedicated for running the experiment in the "project root",
2. Download, install, and set up the experiment dependencies in the "project root",
3. Check the installation setup, and
4. Ask if you want to run the experiment tests.

If you answer yes to run the tests, and they all pass, then you should be all set up to run experiments.
