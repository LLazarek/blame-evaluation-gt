#lang at-exp rscript

;; project-raco has commands:
;; - make
;;   - compiles everything that is not a helper/utility script which can't be compiled on all systems (e.g. uses plot-util/quick)
;; - test
;;   - runs all tests, with the following extra features:
;;     - progress tracking and the ability to resume tests upon failure
;;     - running tests in parallel when possible
;;       + Specifically, we assume modules in different directories are safe to run in parallel
;; - progress
;;   - uses *-progress.log files to report on the progress of operations
;;   - for the main experiment, it can count how many mutants have completed
